# Write a program to perform slicing with given tuple
# (“Python”,1,2,3,”Java”,’A’,’B’) with following slicing point:
# • Print alternate value of tuple.
# • Print value between index 1 to 5.
# • Print the last value of tuple.

#create the tuple
t1=("Pthon",1,2,3,"Java",'A','B')

#print the tuple with index value
print(t1[0])
print(t1[1])
print(t1[2])
print(t1[3])
print(t1[4])
print(t1[5])
print(t1[6])

#print the tuple element between 1 to 5
print(t1[1:6])
#print the last element of the tuple
print(t1[-1])
